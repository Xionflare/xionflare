        <li>Mostly All I Care About is getting good grades and keeping myself entertained</li>
        <li>I'm in this class simply to learn everything I can about coding so I can use it in a career and for fun.</li>
        <li>What I want to get from high school is mostly education to help with my life later on and party because it's fun.</li>
        <li>This website is designed to show my knowledge of technology. I only know a slight bit but it's enough to do this.</li>
